The objectives of this project are as follows:

To develop hands-on experience with survey instruments, including the Total Station and Auto Level.

Conduct a comprehensive survey area surveillance to collect essential preliminary data, identify potential obstacles, and establish control points.

Conduct precise levelling and traversing at control points to ensure vertical and horizontal accuracy.

To create an accurate topographic map of the survey area using QGIS software, representing the terrain and critical features in detail.

An auto level was used for levelling, while a total station was employed for traversing and feature mapping.
